USER STORIES
// user is presented with two options on page load: START and LEADERBOARD
// on 'START', selection screen begins
// user presented with opening selection screen to choose their avatar (diff corgis as option)
// once selected, button pops up to confirm? 
// on click of confirmation button, gameLoop begins
// Reset button shows up at the bottom
// If clicked, reset button takes the player back to the START and LEADERBOARD screen
// premise of the game is you control a lil corgi dog that has to "collect" sheep
// there are wolves (other obstacles) that you need to avoid
// it's a time trial! 
// you're competing against yourself! 
// final timer marks are saved to a High Score leaderboard?

// game is played on Canvas (html)
// background of image is going to be a bucolic pixel art background image
// player controls their little corgi avatar using WASD keydown
// stretch goal: animate sprites through movement frames
// on spacebar keydown, 'bark' soundeffect will trigger. no purpose to it, just fun!
// 10 sheep will be populated on the map (randomly????)
// on collision of sheep and corgi, the sheep will BAAA (trigger baa sound effect), jump up and down(?), and then fade away in 5sec (to return home)
// 10 wolves will also be populated on the map (randomly???) and will move randomly (not much)
// stretch goal: be able to set difficulty by increasing movement speed and movement distance for wolves
// on collision of wolf and corgi, 'snarl' sound effect will trigger and the player will be reset back to starting position on map (player position reset and background reset)
// once all 10 sheep have been collected: win condition TRUE; 'YOU WON!' message shows up, (player sprite idle animation plays)
// player score is added to leaderBoard (if within lowest 10 timer #s)
// OnScreen will also be displayed two buttons: PLAY AGAIN and VIEW LEADERBOARD
// PLAY AGAIN takes player to selection screen, same as start
// VIEW LEADERBOARD takes player to leaderboard, which has lowest scores (>= 10 scores);
