// it's a time trial! P1 versus P2, fastest one wins!

// need to define p1 object and p2 object
const player1 = {
    playername: '1',

const player2 = {
    playername: '2',

// need to create a timer that counts up in seconds
// need to display that timer onscreen

// need to create sheep variable

// when sheep is touched by the aussie avatar, +1 to player score

// press space to bark?

// include background music!
